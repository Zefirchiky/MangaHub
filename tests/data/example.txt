"Oh? You all are here.

Took you much longer than I initially expected.

"

Eisheth greeted with a big smile on her face.

Seeing the Queen in a perfectly normal condition, the rest of the women momentarily glanced at each other and realized it as well.

'I still had some hopes…'

Ember spoke using the connection.

'Don't be foolish, we were away for more than 30 years.

'

This time, the one who defended Eisheth was surprisingly Vyriana.
'I know, I just thought that…'

'What do you expect her to do? It was Nux who gave up on her, not the other way around.

She might have waited for a few years, but it would be foolish to spend the rest of your life being tortured by your own body, even Nux wouldn't want her to do that to herself.'

Vyriana replied.

The women didn't need any proof.

Just the fact that Eisheth's body wasn't continuously trembling was enough to tell that them that she had found a way to satiate her body's desires.

And since there was only one way to do that, the women knew what Eisheth had chosen.

Of course, this didn't mean any of the women here were judging Eisheth for her choices, what happened couldn't be blamed on anyone.

Both Nux and Eisheth had no choice over the matter.

'I actually think better things turned out to be like this.'

Suddenly, Felberta commented.

'It would have been much more difficult meeting an Eisheth who is suffering through the worst form of torture for Nux's sake and telling her that Nux won't be coming back anytime soon.

'

…

The rest of the women were silent.

They knew what Felberta said was right, even Nux would have felt guilty and would have constantly blamed himself if something like that happened.

Honestly, Eisheth here was showing her maturity by taking the correct step without having anyone else feel any sort of pressure.

"Anyways? Where is he? Why do I not sense him?"

While the women were thinking all this, Eisheth questioned.

"He… he is stuck…"

Eisheth narrowed her eyes at that answer, Felberta then went on explaining Nux's and Aisha's situation to Eisheth and the instant the woman heard about her daughter's condition, her expression changed.

"What do I have to do?"

She questioned directly, not wanting to waste much time.

"Prepare an army of Elites, Aisha would then open a portal that would connect this place to her World and you and your army will enter that world through the portal and kill every being you see.

Most of the opponents you will face will be weak, Aisha and the others have already taken care of the enemies that actually matter, you just need to show that you are there for Aisha as reinforcement, then, after annihilating everyone in that world, you and everyone else will surround Aisha and protect her till she devours the World.

"

"I understand, when do I leave?"

"How quickly can you create an army?"

"3 hours."

"Then we leave in 3 hours.

"

Felberta answered and Eisheth instantly left the room after nodding at her and the rest of the women.

Once again, the Queen of Succubus took back the command of her State and started gathering the elites.

"She moves fast when it comes to her daughter."

Ember commented.

"Well, she has always been a good mother."

Felberta commented with a light smile on her face.

The rest of the women nodded as well.

"Anyways, you should go to Aisha now.

"

Vyriana turned towards Felberta and the Eldraeth nodded.

"She has already marked that world, we can open a Portal anytime we want, so there is

no need to hurry.

"

"So what are the rest of us going to do now?"

"We already left a few slaves in each world and ordered them to inform us if something out of the expectation happens, now I just need to watch over Aisha while she devours the World while the rest of you wait for Nux to wake up."

"How long do you think it would take?"

Thyra questioned

Felberta however, shook her head,

"I do not know.

We can only wait for now."

All the women turned silent.

"What about Aeliana, when is she coming back?"

Vyriana questioned with a curious look on her face.

She actually hadn't seen her friend for a long time.

She wasn't inside the [Core] where all

the women were gathered to discuss their further plans.

"When I shared what happened with her, she told me that she would keep an eye on

Aisha in secret,

She says that Nux told her to make sure she protects his wives, so she will do just that.

till all of us come back to Yrniel.

She will return after Aisha devours the world and returns.

"

"She has already fallen, hasn't she?"

Skyla chuckled with a big smile on her face.

"She feels indebted to Nux and wishes to somehow repay him.

"

As someone who understood her friend well, Vyriana answered.

"Oh, she will be 'repaying' him soon enough."

Skyla smiled like an old pervert as she

rubbed her hands together.

"I wonder what expression will she make when I talk to her about her first time.

She is the oldest virgin I know-

That's honestly an achievement since I knew quite a lot of old virgins."

Skyla joked as she glanced at Vyriana.

The Dragon's mouth twitched when she heard those words.

Then, as she glanced at the women around her, a light, 'gentle' smile appeared on her

face and,

"Since Nux might take a while this time and it seems like there is nothing much the rest

of us can do here,

How about we train together again,

It has been a while since we have had some fun, no?" Obviously, the Dragon was continuously looking at Skyla as she said those words.

Skyla's body trembled, her instincts warning her that something bad was going to happen to her, however, before she could resist or come up with some sort of excuse,

"I was going to say that. Another battle freak joined the fray.

"All of this is happened because we are weak,

If we were strong enough to cut the Universe in two, then it wouldn't have dared to threaten us, and Nux wouldn't have to see his wives get hurt.

It feels like he is the only one fighting here and we have yet again turned into baggage

holding him back and we need to change that.

"

Astaria spoke up.

Then, she glanced at Vyriana, her eyes shining threateningly,

"I also wanted to spar with you for a long time now.

"

"Sure, you all can band together and come at me, I wouldn't mind."

"I am talking about a one-on-one battle."

"

"Big words from someone who cannot defeat me even when she fights in a group. Defeat

me together with your sisters first and then have thoughts about a one-on-one battle.

The only one who is going to have a one-on-one battle with me is her."

The Dragon spoke as she placed her hand on Skyla's shoulder, once again, the poor maid

just trembled.

As the women continued their discussion, time passed, Eisheth quickly returned, already done gathering her army.

The Mother and the two Sisters were ready with their weapons, yes, the entire Lust family was going to help their youngest, after all, this is what family does.

Felberta nodded, then, the Lust women took her to an open ground where an army of ten thousand elites was gathered, with the weakest being a Sage.

Yes, it was overkill for a World that only had a few Sages left at best, but since they were going to put on a show, Eisheth decided to go all out.

And it wasn't like the Lust State was going to be attacked by some other force if they

were out anyway, with their close connection with Nux, no fool would ever attack them

when they are at their weakest, and even if some unlucky fellow does attack them, they would just end up hastening their deaths, delivering themselves to the monsters who were training here to get even stronger, strong enough to 'cut the Universe in two' to be

more precise.

Anyways, seeing the army in front of her, Felberta quickly opened hundreds of portals,

connecting them to the World Aisha was in, when the portals were opened, Eisheth

nodded and Rislith, the future Queen stepped forward and gained the army's attention,

"People of the Lust State!"

She called.

"The instant you step into that Portal, you will be taken into a completely different place

and see beings with abilities you have never seen before,

But don't forget,

We are the Strongest,

Our only Goal is to perish the enemy,

Whether it is a child, or an old couple,

Show no mercy, We will kill them all!

For our Princess!!!"

"FOR OUR PRINCESS!!!"

A huge roar was heard, and the next instant, the army rushed into the Portal.

"AAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!"

"FOR OUR PRINCESSS!!!"

In a World where Aisha sat alone, worried and tensed about her husband's condition,

suddenly, loud shouts were heard as hundreds of portals formed and an army of thousands of soldiers rushed in.

Aisha turned around and recognizing her own people, she realized that the plan was

initiated.

She simply stood up, watching her soldiers rushing towards the worlds residents, "KILLL!!!!"

A merciless slaughter started.

There were millions of residents, the Lust army was heavily outnumbered, but what

could mortals do against nigh invincible cultivators?

It didn't take long for the soldiers to notice how weak the enemies were, the slaughter

sped up. Aisha, who continued to watch it all didn't say much.

*Step* *Step* *Step* Suddenly, she heard some footsteps, turning around, her eyes fell on her sisters and her

mother.

"Stuck in quite a situation, I see.

"

Rislith laughed.

"The big sister had to come to bring back the youngest, after all.

"

"That's what you are supposed to do, isn't it?"

Aisha chuckled.

"I guess that is true.

"

Rislith nodded.

Aisha's eyes then fell on her mother, and the instant it did, her expression changed.

"Mother, you…"
